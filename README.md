# MatchboxDAO Hackathon - PokeCenter
PokeCenter is Starknet contract for social media gaming. You can create post, comment on post, upvote/downvote content. Moreover, you can attach something like attestion (proof of ownership of some nft) to increase your creditability.

## Limitation
- voyager explorer only support for felt only and does not support Uint256 yet. You may need to use cli or script to interact with the contracts
- post and comment data can contain only 31 characters because lack of string supported in Cairo. We may implement String if we have enough time ðŸ˜›
